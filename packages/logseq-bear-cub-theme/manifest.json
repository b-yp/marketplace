  "title": "Bear Cub Theme for Logseq",
  "description": "The Bear Cub theme is minimalistic and functional.  This theme doesn't distract you with an explosion of color and graphical elements. Instead, it helps you stay focused. It creates a clear distinction between different structural and functional elements, which helps you see a bigger picture at a glance at any time.",
